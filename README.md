Working at this job I have a variety of different tasks to complete. I often ran a company truck and operated, lawnmowers, weed eaters, edgers, hedgers, chainsaws, brush hogs, and tractors. Going to different jobs, most being regular maintenance and others requiring brush clearing or bed installations. Other aspects of the job include customer relations and equipment maintenance.
